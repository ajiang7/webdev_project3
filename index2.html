    <h2>What are Vtubers?</h2>
    <p>Vtubers, or Virtual YouTubers, are online entertainers who use digital avatars to engage with their audiences. These avatars are typically animated using motion capture technology, allowing performers to express themselves in real-time while maintaining anonymity.</p>
    <p>The concept of digital avatars representing content creators dates back to early internet forums and virtual reality experiments, but Vtubers as we know them today originated in Japan in the mid-2010s. Kizuna AI, often credited as the first major Vtuber, debuted in 2016 and set the stage for what would become a massive industry.</p>
    <p>Over time, Vtubing has evolved beyond just streaming, with many performers producing high-quality music, animation, and scripted content. The fandom surrounding Vtubers has grown exponentially, with millions of viewers tuning in from around the world.</p>
